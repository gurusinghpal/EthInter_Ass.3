# Types of Functions

The MyToken contract is an ERC20-compliant token contract that allows users to create and manage their own token. This contract provides functionalities such as token minting, transferring tokens between addresses, and burning tokens.


## Description

The provided code snippet is a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token contract named "MyToken". It includes functionalities for token transfers, minting tokens, and burning tokens.

Overall, this contract provides a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token with functionalities for transferring tokens, minting new tokens, and burning tokens.


## Getting Started

### Installing

To run the contract, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start a blockchain locally by running the command: 
   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```
3. Test the contract by running the command: 
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```

4. Deploy the MyToken smart contract by running the deployment script:

   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Executing program

* Go to [remix](remix.ethereum.org) IDE.
* Paste the contract in the IDE.
* Compile the contract.
* Select the `Dev - Hardhat Provider` as the environment in Deploy tab.
* Paste you contract address in remix and click on `At Address`.
* Interact with your contract in remix!!

1. Clone this repository or copy the code from the smart contract file.

2. Compile the smart contract using your preferred Solidity compiler.

3. Deploy the smart contract to your chosen Ethereum development environment.

4. Interact with the contract using the provided functions (`mint`, `transfer`, and `burn`).
